 * *Why another cache?*
At SHOP.COM, we've tried almost every cache system there is. None of them do what we need. 

 * *What's different about SHOP.COM Cache?*
`*` It doesn't try to be a database<br>
`*` It can handle very large objects and very large keys<br>
`*` Cached objects can survive a server crash<br>
`*` Has both a local (in-memory) and external/shared cache<br>
`*` Extremely fast - >20K transactions a minute (depending on hardware)<br>
See the [Comparison] wiki for more.

 * *What kinds of things can be cached?*
Any Serializable object. In practice, it's common to cache database result sets, HTML pages, HTTP sessions, etc.

 * *Why open source it?*
Our cache was written by one engineer (me). We'd like more eyes on the code and help maintaining it.
