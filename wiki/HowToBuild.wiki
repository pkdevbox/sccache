#summary How to build SHOP.COM Cache from the sources

= Introduction =

SHOP.COM Cache is self-contained and can be easily compiled using any build system you like or from the command line using `javac`. The source is distributed as a several modules that can be compiled into separate JARs. If you prefer, though, you can compile everything into one JAR.

= Modules =

Because of internal dependencies, the source should be built in the following steps:

 # Build the `chunked` module. It's used by nearly every other module.
 # Build the `generic_io` module with `chunked` in the CLASSPATH.
 # Build the `api` module with `chunked` in the CLASSPATH.

The above constitute the API portion of SHOP.COM cache. If you are using a custom implementation you can stop here. To build the default implementation:

 # Build the `ccdb2` module with `chunked` in the CLASSPATH.
 # Build the `common` module with `api` in the CLASSPATH.
 # Build the `storage` module with `chunked`, `ccdb2` and `api` in the CLASSPATH.
 # Build the `client` module with `chunked`, `generic_io`, `common` and `api` in the CLASSPATH.
 # Build the `server` module with `chunked`, `generic_io`, `common` and `api` in the CLASSPATH.
