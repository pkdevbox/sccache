#summary The design choices made for SHOP.COM Cache

= Design Choices =

Here are some of the design choices that have been made in the development of the SHOP.COM Cache.

*No transactions*<br>
If you need transactions, you should use a database. A cache should be used to provide quick access to data that doesn't change very often. 

*Memory based index*<br>
The default implementation stores the cache index in memory. This should be considered when planning hardware needs.

*Maximum TTL*<br>
The default implementation assumes a predefined maximum TTL as a compile time constant. Objects in the cache cannot exceed this maximum (12 hours by default).

*Optimized for reads over writes*<br>
The cache is highly optimized for fast reads.

*SoftReferences and no object qty limit*<br>
There are no object qty limits. Instead, sccache relies on SoftReferences and the JVM. However, this has GC implications. You may need to tune your java command line arguments.
